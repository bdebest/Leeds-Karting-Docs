            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This handbook guides the Leeds Karting Employment Team in all aspects of human resources, from recruitment to offboarding. Our goal is to attract, develop, and retain the best talent for our Roblox go-karting company, ensuring that all staff members are well-suited for their roles and contribute positively to our community. This handbook specifically covers the employment of staff in roles such as Guest Services Associate, First Aid Officer, Track Marshall, Developer, Kart Mechanic, and Security. The General Manager and Board of Directors roles have separate management and oversight responsibilities.

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 pl-4 mb-4">
                <li>Vacancies for staff roles are announced through the `/employmentpost` command, which is exclusively used by the Board of Directors. This command publishes available positions for the community to see.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">2.2 Application Process</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 pl-4 mb-4">
                <li>Interested users apply for roles by using the `/apply` command, which initiates an application ticket.</li>
                <li>Within this ticket, applicants will be asked a series of questions (the specific questions are detailed in a separate, internal document).</li>
                <li>The Employment Team reviews these applications, paying close attention to **Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG)**, as well as the **accuracy and thoughtfulness** of the responses.</li>
                <li>**Second Opinion:** It is mandatory to seek a second opinion from another member of the Employment Team for every application review.</li>
                <li>**Background Checks:** Before any acceptance, a thorough background check must be conducted. This includes:
                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1 pl-6 mt-1">
                        <li>A security server background check to identify any past security incidents or red flags.</li>
                        <li>A moderation history check within the Leeds Karting server to review any past violations or disciplinary actions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>**Acceptance Criteria:** An application can only be accepted if **two members** of the Employment Team agree on the applicant's suitability after reviewing their responses and conducting all necessary background checks.</li>
                <li>**Notification of Results:**
                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1 pl-6 mt-1">
                        <li>**Accepted Applicants:** Will be notified of their successful application, congratulated, and immediately given the appropriate staff roles within the Discord server and in-game.</li>
                        <li>**Denied Applicants:** Will be notified of their denial. While specific reasons for denial are generally not provided to maintain fairness and prevent circumvention, general feedback (e.g., "lacking sufficient detail in responses," "issues identified in background check") may be given at the team's discretion.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><span class="font-semibold">`/applicationclose [ticketID]`:</span> Used to close an application ticket once it has been reviewed and a decision has been made. Always include a reason in the ticket's notes.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">`/applicationblacklist [user]`:</span> Used to prevent a specific user from submitting future applications. This command should be used only for severe or repeated misuse of the application system, or for individuals deemed unsuitable for employment due to significant past violations. Requires Supervisor or General Manager approval.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">`/applicationunblacklist [user]`:</span> Used to remove a user from the application blacklist, allowing them to apply again. This should only occur after a review of their past conduct and a decision by management that they are now eligible.</li>

                The Employment Team is responsible for ensuring a smooth transition for new hires into their roles. While departmental Supervisors conduct the direct training, the Employment Team has an oversight role.

                <li>**Escalation:** If a Supervisor fails to conduct the required training within the one-week timeframe, the Employment Team is responsible for bringing this matter directly to the attention of the Board of Directors for immediate resolution.</li>

                <li>**Review Focus:** The review should assess the employee's adherence to their role responsibilities, understanding of policies, teamwork, communication, and overall contribution. Feedback should be constructive and aimed at fostering growth.</li>
