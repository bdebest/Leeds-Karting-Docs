            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Tickets submitted to Leeds Karting support can cover a wide range of topics. Understanding the different categories will help you direct and resolve issues efficiently.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 pl-4">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Moderation Tickets:</span> These include appeals for in-game bans or mutes, questions regarding specific rule enforcement actions, or requests for clarification on our guidelines.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Player Reports:</span> Submissions from players reporting others for violating in-game rules, such as exploiting, griefing, intentional crashing, or toxic behavior in chat. These often require evidence review.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Application Tickets:</span> Inquiries related to staff applications, including questions about the application process, status updates, or feedback on rejected applications.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Bug Reports:</span> Reports of unexpected behavior, glitches, broken features, or technical issues experienced within the Leeds Karting Roblox game. Detailed descriptions and reproduction steps are often necessary.</li>

                <li><span class="font-semibold">General Inquiries:</span> Broad questions about the game, upcoming events, community activities, or general information that doesn't fit into other specific categories.</li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4 border-b border-gray-300 pb-2">3. Ticket Handling Procedures</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Follow these steps to ensure every ticket is handled professionally and efficiently:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 pl-4">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Claiming Tickets:</span> Always claim a ticket before you begin working on it. This prevents multiple staff members from working on the same issue and ensures clear accountability.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Unclaiming/Passing Along:</span> If you claim a ticket and realize you cannot resolve it (e.g., it requires a different department's expertise, or it needs escalation), unclaim it and clearly note the reason for unclaiming and who it should be passed to in the 'Reason Box'.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Initial Introduction:</span> When you first respond to a ticket, introduce yourself clearly. State your name/role (e.g., "Hello, I'm [Your Name/Role] from Leeds Karting Support.") and briefly explain that you are reviewing their issue (e.g., "I'll be assisting you with your ticket regarding [brief issue summary].").</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Utilizing Commands/Tools:</span> Familiarize yourself with and effectively use all available internal commands and tools (e.g., `!playerinfo [username]`, `!checkban [username]`, `!issuepenalty [type] [reason]`) to gather necessary information, apply actions, or document interactions.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">When to Close a Ticket:</span>
                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1 pl-6 mt-1">
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Resolved:</span> The user's issue has been fully addressed, their question answered, or the reported bug/problem has been fixed.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Inactivity:</span> If the user fails to respond to your queries or requests for information within a specified timeframe (e.g., 48-72 hours), the ticket can be closed due to inactivity. Always send a final message informing them of the closure and how to reopen/create a new ticket if needed.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Disrespectful/Abusive:</span> If the user becomes excessively disrespectful, abusive, or uses hate speech, the ticket may be closed. Depending on severity, this may also warrant disciplinary action against the user.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Spam/Off-Topic:</span> Tickets that are clearly spam, irrelevant, or repeatedly asking for already answered questions after warnings can be closed.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-semibold">Duplicate:</span> If the same issue has already been reported and is being handled in another ticket, the duplicate ticket should be closed with a reference to the active one.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">The 'Reason Box':</span> It is **MANDATORY** to always utilize the 'Reason Box' or equivalent internal notes section when closing or transferring a ticket. This box must contain a clear, concise summary of:
                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1 pl-6 mt-1">
                        <li>The initial issue.</li>
                        <li>All actions taken by staff (e.g., "Issued warning," "Checked logs," "Provided link to handbook").</li>
                        <li>The final resolution or reason for closure.</li>
                        <li>Any relevant observations or next steps.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This ensures transparency, accountability, and provides a clear history for future reference.
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Ticket Blacklist Usage:</span> A ticket blacklist (or similar system to prevent a user from creating new tickets) should only be used in extreme cases of repeated and severe abuse of the ticketing system (e.g., persistent spamming, harassment through tickets, or circumventing bans by creating new tickets). This action requires approval from a Supervisor or General Manager and should only be applied after warnings have been issued and documented.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Not every ticket can be resolved by a Standard Employee. Knowing when and how to escalate is vital for effective support.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 pl-4">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">When to Escalate:</span>
                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1 pl-6 mt-1">
                        <li>The issue requires higher-level permissions or tools you do not possess.</li>
                        <li>The issue is complex, sensitive, or involves a high-profile community member.</li>
                        <li>You have exhausted your knowledge or resources and require expert assistance.</li>
                        <li>The ticket involves a staff member or a potential breach of internal policy.</li>
                        <li>The user is becoming excessively agitated or abusive, and you require assistance in de-escalation or applying disciplinary action.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Following the Chain of Command:</span> When escalating a ticket, always follow the Chain of Command as outlined in the Staff Handbook. Direct the ticket and a clear summary of the situation (using the 'Reason Box') to your immediate Supervisor. If your Supervisor is unavailable or the issue directly involves them, escalate to a General Manager.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Asking for Help:</span> Do not hesitate to ask your Supervisor or a General Manager for assistance with a ticket. It is far better to seek guidance and ensure a correct resolution than to provide incorrect information, mishandle a situation, or leave a user's concern unresolved. Collaboration is key to our success.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                To excel in ticket handling and provide exceptional support, consider these best practices:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 pl-4">
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Empathy and Patience:</span> Approach every ticket with empathy. Understand that the user might be frustrated. Be patient and maintain a calm, helpful tone, even with difficult individuals.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Clear and Concise Responses:</span> Provide answers that are easy to understand. Avoid jargon where possible, and get straight to the point. If a solution is complex, break it down into simple steps.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Timeliness:</span> Aim to respond to and resolve tickets as quickly as possible. Prompt responses show that you value the user's time and concern.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Thoroughness:</span> Ensure you have gathered all necessary information before attempting to resolve an issue. Don't assume; ask clarifying questions if needed. Double-check your work before closing a ticket.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Documentation is Key:</span> As emphasized, always use the 'Reason Box' comprehensively. Good documentation benefits everyone, from other staff members needing context to management reviewing performance.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Learn from Each Ticket:</span> Every ticket is an opportunity to learn. Pay attention to common issues, new bugs, or effective solutions. Share insights with your team to improve overall support quality.</li>
                <li><span class="font-semibold">Maintain Professionalism:</span> Even if a user is rude, maintain your professional demeanor. Do not engage in arguments. Refer to the 'Disrespectful/Abusive' closing criteria if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
